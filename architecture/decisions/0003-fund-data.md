# 3. Fetch fund data

Date: 2022-08-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to be able to show users data about:
- Current fund timeline
- Next fund
- Current fund proposals
- Current fund challenges

## Decision

We will use VIT Servicing Station to serve this data to the frontend.

## Consequences

All Fund data will be served to the Frontend from VIT-SS directly and not stored in the GVC Backend.
